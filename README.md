✉️ Unsent Letters – A Personal Blogging Platform

Unsent Letters is a full-stack **Node.js/Express** blog project where users can write, edit, and delete personal letters that remain unsent. My goal was to create a space for personal storytelling while building hands-on experience with **backend development, database integration, and API usage**.
